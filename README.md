# AI.SpyPotato
this is weekly project I am working on with TIPSE. 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8mrtHXOZKe_lCeGNaMdU02nlgGOt-bpnW6d4e1fX2c/edit?gid=633198663#gid=633198663
FOLLOW ALONG WITH OUR PROJECTS. 
learn ML/DL/DP with me. *brainstorming*, small potatoes, small dirt clusters, identified and separated for famers., 
My First Thoughts: 
- Will the hardware be sufficient for the vision I am creating?
- Will I have enough processing power for this project?
- How can I scale this project to reach more potato farmers?
- It shouldnt take too much to download this software, like an upgraded brain for the potato sorter.
